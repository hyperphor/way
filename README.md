## Clustered Heatmaps

![Heatmap](doc/assets/heatmap.png)

Clustered heatmaps are a powerful data visualization technique that combines the functionalities of heatmaps and hierarchical clustering. A heatmap uses color to represent the values in a data matrix, allowing for an immediate visual assessment of patterns and trends. Each cell in the matrix is colored according to its value, making it easy to spot anomalies and relationships within the data. 

Hierarchical clustering groups similar data points into clusters based on their characteristics, creating a tree (dendrogram).

When these two techniques are combined, the rows and columns of the heatmap are reordered based on the clustering results, grouping similar data points together. This reordering makes the patterns and relationships within the data more apparent. Clustered heatmaps are particularly useful for identifying patterns, reducing data complexity, and revealing hidden structures within large data sets. 

The code to generate clustered heatmaps is actually pretty simple, and lives in two files:

- [Vega specification generator](src/cljs/hyperphor/way/cheatmap.cljs)
- [Clustering](src/cljc/hyperphor/way/cluster.cljc)

A [simple example](src/cljs/hyperphor/way/demo/heatmap.cljs#L167) of use.

## Development

To run locally:

### Install

- Java
- NodeJS
- Leiningen
    
### Run Demo

    npm install
    lein shadow compile app
    lein run <port>

### Deploy

lein deploy clojars
using Hyperphor token

### Notes

The demo app is included in Way itself, for my personal convenience. This is a bit iffy and probably should be undone at some point.
